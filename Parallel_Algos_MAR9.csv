This is optimal assuming that the input sequence must be fed to the sorter sequentially. The paper seems to mean that data is transferred from the memory to the sorter sequentially but it does not clearly state if multiple sequences can be read from memory simultaneously. When n > m, then the input sequence is divided into n/m segments and the single sorter is used once for each of (n/m)^2 pairs of segments. Since the sorter takes O(m) time every time it is used, total time complexity is O(n^2/m). The time complexity can be reduced by using multiple sorters in parallel. However, the way they describe it is a bit confusing. The paper says that (n/m)^2 sorters will be used in parallel. But doing so will require simultaneously accessing (n/m) segments from the memory. That will require only O(m) time for reading the input and computing the c_ij values. Seems like the O(n) time complexity comes from writing the c_i values sequentially to the memory. To me it seems like one can use only n/m sorters in a pipelined sequence (like a single sorter of size n composed of n/m sorters of size m each put in sequence) and read the input only once from the memory and execute the entire algorithm like the algorithm for the original m >= n case. This will require only O(n) time. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total number of n-sorter required is O(m * (log(m) / log(n))^2) as opposed to O(m * (log(mn))^2) given in the paper, and the time complexity is O(n * (log(m) / log(n))^2) as opposed to O(n * (log(mn))^2). The summation given for the number of n-sorters should go from i = 1 to k (instead of i = 0 to k - 1). The solution to the recurrence M(nm) is correct. The analysis given in the paper basically shows that the algorithm sorts n^k numbers using \Theta((n^{k-1}) k^2)  n-sorters, and assuming an n-sorter takes O(1) time to execute the time complexity of the algorithm is \Theta(n k^2). In that case, the total work is asymptotically the same as the total number of n-sorters needed, i.e., \Theta((n^{k-1}) k^2). Since mn = n^k, we have k = log(mn) / log(n) = 1 + log(m)/log(n).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each BSP/CGM algorithm consists of an alternation between local computations and global communication rounds. Each communication round consists of routing a single h-relation with h = O(s). Each CGM computation and communication round corresponds to a BSP super-step with communication costs g x s [19]. Here, g is the communication cost of a word in the BSP model. To produce efficient BSP/CGM parallel algorithms, designers tend to maximize the speedup and minimize the number of communication rounds (which are ideally independent of the problem size and constant in the optimum)."" The complexities of the algorithm can be found in the abstract and the Introdcution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, I was looking at their implementation here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/blob/master/Filters/ParallelStatistics/vtkPDescriptiveStatistics.cxx. The code was updated 5 months ago. That implementation (MPI-based distributed) has a parallel running time of \Theta( n/p + p ). The work is \Theta( n ), but the span (by definition) is also \Theta( n ) as the maximum number of processors one can use is p = n. However, with p = sqrt(n), one can gets the smallest parallel running time of \Theta( sqrt( n ) ). This \Theta( sqrt( n ) ) is the correct span which can be derived from parallelism. Since parallelism is an upper bound on speedup and the maximum speedup one can achieve is \T, heta( sqrt( n ) ) with p = sqrt( n ), parallelism will be sqrt( n ). But parallelism = T_1 / T_inf. Since T_1 = \Theta( n ), we get T_inf = \Theta( sqrt( n ) ).",,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,6,,,Numerical Analysis
